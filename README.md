# Projet-ShisuiMarket

The primary objective of the ongoing project is to create a virtual platform with the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of trading strategies within a simulated setting. The ultimate aim is to provide users with a risk-free tool that enables them to test and refine their trading strategies without any real financial consequences. This platform will serve as a secure space where traders can experiment with diverse trading approaches and assess the outcomes of their decisions. The project involves a team of developers who are responsible for designing and implementing the platform, traders who will utilize the tool to evaluate their strategies, and project managers who will oversee the project's progress and success. Through collaborative efforts, these stakeholders will contribute to establishing a robust and efficient virtual environment for evaluating trading strategies.
